# MCOA — Antigravity Master Development Prompt

> **Project:** Medical Coding Officers Academy (MCOA)  
> **Goal:** Build a premium, production-ready academy website and integrated CRM, LMS, coding practice, and administration platform, deployed on Vercel.  
> **How to use:** Paste this specification into Google Antigravity, attach the approved MCOA logo, and ask the agent to implement the project phase by phase.

## 1. Your role and development standards

Act as a principal full-stack software architect, senior Next.js engineer, UX/UI designer, database architect, LMS specialist, medical coding education product designer, DevOps engineer, and security engineer.

Build a maintainable, modular **working application**, not a static mockup. Use real database-backed workflows, server-side authorization, input validation, tests, documentation, and deployment instructions. Do not fake payments, messages, coding results, student records, or integrations. When a third-party service is not configured, show a clear **Not configured** state and instructions.

Before coding, inspect the repository, propose an architecture, route map, permission matrix, database model, phased milestones, and acceptance tests. Implement each phase, test it, and ask for review before moving to the next major phase or making destructive changes.

## 26. Start now — Antigravity execution instruction

**First**, inspect the existing repository and produce:

1. Architecture and dependency plan
2. Route map and role-based user journeys
3. Database ERD and initial Prisma schema
4. Permission matrix
5. Brand design tokens and component inventory
6. Integration prerequisites and credentials checklist
7. Phased delivery plan with acceptance criteria

**Then implement Phase 1**, beginning with the design system, premium responsive homepage, public course catalog, database-backed inquiry form, authentication, CRM, and working admin dashboard. Add tests and prepare a Vercel staging deployment. Ask for approval before any destructive database operation or production cutover.

**Critical:** Do not claim a feature works until it has been implemented and tested. Clearly report incomplete integrations and licensing dependencies.
